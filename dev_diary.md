Welcome to the diary of this developer.
I will post interesting bits and pieces of my engine's development process here.

### Check Out These Cool Bugs That I got
The bugs are a big part of what makes me love graphics.
#
#### Memory Garbage

What's really cool here is that there is no texture information at all. This is a one-line fragment shader that's outputting memory garbage.

#### Normals Generation
I implemented a surface normal generator and here is a cool bug :

Correct result :
